            <h1>What is CERTOVA</h1>
            <p>At CERTOVA, we believe every child deserves the opportunity to succeed academically, regardless of their background or circumstances. Our non-profit organization is dedicated to empowering children, particularly those from immigrant families, by providing them with the knowledge and resources they need to navigate the high school education system effectively.</p>
            <p>Founded out of a deep concern for the challenges faced by immigrant children, CERTOVA aims to bridge the gap in educational equity. We understand that navigating the complexities of high school can be overwhelming, especially for those who may not have access to guidance and support. Our mission is to illuminate the pathway to academic success by offering engaging workshops, mentorship programs, and personalized resources that demystify the educational journey.</p>
            <p>Through our innovative programs, we educate children on navigating academic expectations, understanding their rights and responsibilities, and developing the critical skills needed to thrive. By fostering a supportive community, we empower young learners to take charge of their education and future.</p>
            <p>Join us at CERTOVA as a student or volunteer as we work to create a brighter, more inclusive educational experience for all students. Together, we can ensure that every child has the tools to achieve their dreams and reach their fullest potential.</p>

            <h3>"We got the idea for this organization from our struggles as immigrant kids in the American system. It was hard to understand what was going on, so we were always outcompeted. We decided later that it would be beneficial if this was accessible to everyone, not just immigrant children."</h3>
